ez-doc
======

Good documentation means good content, that makes sense. But good content poorly presented will make it more difficult to truly take in all the good things being said. Good presentation is structured, simple to navigate, legible, and aestetichally pleasing. Good presentation is often also consistent, even across projects.

This can be difficult and time consuming to achieve so we introduce ez-doc â€“ the Zambezi documentation site generator.

It's a command line tool to generate Zambezi style documentation from markdown source files, suitable for static hosting. Using ez-doc, you can trivially turn structured markdown into beautifully presented documentation, without the need for configuration or additional coding. 

With knowledge of the common structure of [Zambezi projects](https://github.com/zambezi/project), ez-doc understands your project and thus lets you focus on content, while it focuses on presenting that content in a consinstent, beautiful manner. This focus on zero configuration is not accidental, but a core goal of ez-doc. Documentation should be easy and fun to write, not a cumbersome chore.
